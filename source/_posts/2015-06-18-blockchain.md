## Use blockchain bitcoin service to transfer bitcoins

### [Wallet api](https://blockchain.info/api/blockchain_wallet_api)

```
https://blockchain.info/merchant/$guid/payment
?password=$main_password
&second_password=$second_password
&to=$address
&amount=$amount
&from=$from
&fee=$fee
&note=$note
```

Request tips:

> The My Wallet API provides a simple interface Merchants can use interact with their wallet. Blockchain.info will decrypt the wallet on our server manipulate it as necessary and re-save. HTTP GET and POST are supported. However, if a POST request is sent without "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" header, some endpoints may not work correctly.

### /payment

```
https://blockchain.info/merchant/59fee004-0115-4861-8e4a-7f8af3ba31fb/payment
?password=$main_password
&second_password=$second_password
&to=$address
&amount=$amount
&from=$from
&fee=$fee
&note=$note
```

returns:

```
{
  "error": "Api Access is disabled. Enable it in Account Settings."
}
```

Then we have to enable API access from the Account Settings on Blockchain.

```
[Account Settings] -> [IP Restrictions] -> [Enable Api Access]
```

Then we call the API, returns:

```
{
  "error": "API Access approval needed. Please check your email."
}
```

From our Email inbox, we got a alert `Authorize API access attempt`, we only have to click the link to get the access continue.

Otherwise, user can add the server ip to their account IP white list.

> From the 1st December 2014, in order to use this API, access must be explicitly enabled, and all client ip addresses whitelisted by the wallet owner. Manage access in [Account Settings] -> [IP Restrictions]. Wallets created via the Create Wallet API can bypass this by including the same API key used to create the wallet, in all requests.

Then we update our request to this form(filled some blank parameters):

```
https://blockchain.info/merchant/a4bde787-3512-4b68-a669-91771dff514c/payment
?password=password
&second_password=password
&to=1NV6sH3hS2u5Fnbey5Vh32ho3P3x23CXM2
&amount=1
&from=123m1f3ZeWV5RMfJgrPNb3t3rvVbeB5mTD
&fee=1
&note=This is only for testing.
```

Of course, got an 'error':

```
{
  "error": "No free outputs to spend"
}
```

That's it!

Next, charge a few bitcoins to my wallet, then transfer 100à¸¿ to another wallet.

API call finished, returns:

```
{
  tx_hash: "7f2c5f0c108351370779824db23e01628240f423b1490ec48c52a7654555afee",
  message: "Sent To Multiple Recipients"
}
```

But the target wallet **didn't** get the money.

Check the Blockchain dashboard, it shows:

> Unconfirmed Transaction!

Thus, I need to **confirm** this transaction.

For the exactly meaning of **confirm**, I checked the transaction I transfered from LocalBitcoins to Blockchain, it shows `7 Confirmations`. So I think it's some kind of p2p server confirmation. Maybe not managed by myself.

After over 20 minutes, it still not confirmed.

In the meantime, I did it again, to a different wallet(at Coinbase, 200 bit):

```
{
  error: "Insufficient Funds Available: 0 Needed: 10200"
}
```

YES, That's because my previous transaction was still unconfirmed.
