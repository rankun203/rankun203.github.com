## Background

Lately, I have been delving into papers from a new field, and I often find the sentences challenging to comprehend. Instead of searching for clarification online, which disrupts my flow and hinders my ability to follow the author's thought process, I have been trying alternative strategies.

## Proposed Shortcuts

During the process, I developed several shortcuts utilizing LLMs, These methods assisted me in explaining concepts, answering my questions, and proof-reading my writings.
