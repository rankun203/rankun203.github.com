## Background

Recently, I've been reading papers. Since it's a new field to me, I 
often find the sentences in the paper hard to understand. Usually 
I would just go google them, but that breaks the flow and I ended 
up failing to follow the author's thoughts.

## Proposed Shortcuts

In resolving this issue, I developed a few shortcuts, utilizing LLMs 
to help me explain sentences, answer my questions, and proofread 
my writings.
